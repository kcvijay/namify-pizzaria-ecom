Total delivery fee consists of 3 separate fees: Base Delivery Fee, Surcharge, and Bulk Fee. Requirements considered to calculate the total delivery fees are:

- If the total order amount exceeds 200 ‚Ç¨, the total delivery fee is 0 ‚Ç¨.
- If the order amount is less than 10 ‚Ç¨, a surcharge is charged. The surcharge is the difference between 10 ‚Ç¨ and the order amount.
- If the order items are less than 4, the Base Delivery Fee is 0 ‚Ç¨. Each more than 4 and less than 12 items add 0.50 ‚Ç¨. More than 12 items add 1.20 ‚Ç¨ on the top of that.
- If the delivery distance is less than 1000 meters, the base delivery fee is 2 ‚Ç¨. Every exceeding 500 meters adds 1 ‚Ç¨ to the base delivery fee.
- If the order is placed on Friday between 15 pm - 19 pm (Friday Rush), the delivery fee is multiplied by 1.20.
- The total delivery fee cannot be more than 15 ‚Ç¨.
